1. Opening Positioning Statement (Your “Executive Introduction”)
Use this at the start of the interview when they say: “Tell me about yourself.”
Example (customizable):
“I’m a technology leader with deep experience in enterprise application architecture, large‑scale delivery, and integration strategy. Over my career, I’ve led multi-system transformation programs, established architecture governance models, and partnered closely with business and IT leadership to align technology roadmaps with organizational goals. In my current role as a Delivery Architect, I’ve driven end-to-end solution designs, modernized legacy platforms, and led cross-functional teams through complex system implementations. I’m passionate about creating scalable, secure, and future-ready architectures that support business growth.”
This frames you as a high-level architect with leadership influence and enterprise perspective.
