Bachelor’s degree or equivalent practical experience.
3 years of experience with SAP technologies (SAP HANA, SAP Business Suite, S/4HANA, SAP Business Warehouse) and their infrastructure requirements.
Experience implementing SAP projects on public cloud platforms, with a focus on core production concepts (High Availability, Disaster Recovery, Multi-tenancy, Scale-out/Scale-up).

Here are targeted, role-appropriate questions you can suggest or prepare for in a Google hiring assessment aligned to that job description.

## SAP on Public Cloud – Architecture \& Infra

1. How would you design an SAP S/4HANA landscape on a public cloud (e.g., GCP) to meet high availability requirements across zones and regions?
2. What are the key infrastructure sizing and storage considerations for SAP HANA in a scale-up vs. scale-out deployment?
3. How do you design and test disaster recovery for SAP S/4HANA on cloud, and what RPO/RTO trade-offs do you consider?
4. Explain how you would secure SAP HANA and SAP Business Suite workloads on cloud at the network, OS, and database layers.
5. Describe an end-to-end migration approach for moving an on‑premise SAP system to a public cloud, including cutover strategy and rollback planning.

## Production Concepts: HA, DR, Multi-Tenancy, Scale

6. What is your approach to implementing HA for SAP Central Services (ASCS/SCS) on cloud, and how does it differ from database HA?
7. How would you design multi‑tenant SAP landscapes (e.g., multiple business units or countries) on a single cloud platform while maintaining isolation and cost control?
8. Describe a scenario where you would choose scale‑up vs. scale‑out for SAP HANA and why.
9. How do you monitor and proactively remediate performance bottlenecks for SAP systems running on cloud infrastructure?
10. What capacity planning methods do you use to handle seasonal or unpredictable load patterns in SAP systems on cloud?

## Automation \& DevOps for SAP Infra

11. How would you use Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform) to provision a complete SAP S/4HANA environment on cloud?
12. Describe how you’d integrate configuration management tools (Ansible/Puppet/Chef) to standardize OS and SAP parameter configurations.
13. How can CI/CD concepts be applied to SAP-related infrastructure (e.g., blue‑green deployments of app servers or HANA patching)?
14. Give an example pipeline using Jenkins (or similar) to automate build, test, and deployment steps for SAP infrastructure changes.
15. How do you ensure idempotency, repeatability, and environment consistency when using automation for SAP landscapes?

## SAP Stack Expertise

16. Compare typical infrastructure requirements and constraints for SAP HANA vs. SAP Business Warehouse vs. SAP Business Suite.
17. How do you design and secure data flows between SAP S/4HANA, SAP BW, and external analytics platforms on cloud?
18. What are common performance pitfalls in SAP HANA on cloud and how do you diagnose and resolve them?
19. Describe how you would design backup and restore strategies for SAP HANA that align with business RPO/RTO.
20. How do you validate that an SAP system running on cloud is SAP‑certified and supported from both vendor and cloud provider perspectives?

## Cloud \& GCP-Specific Thinking

21. How would you map SAP tiers (presentation, application, database) to cloud services such as VMs, load balancers, storage, and networking constructs?
22. What considerations go into choosing regions, zones, and machine types for SAP workloads in a hyperscaler environment?
23. How would you optimize cost for a large SAP S/4HANA landscape on cloud without compromising SLAs?
24. Describe how you’d design logging, monitoring, and alerting for SAP systems using native cloud observability tools.
25. How would you handle network design (VPCs, subnets, peering, hybrid connectivity) for SAP systems that integrate with on‑premise and other SaaS apps?

## Behavioural / Scenario-Based

26. Describe a challenging SAP migration or greenfield implementation you led on public cloud: what was your role, the architecture, and the outcomes?
27. Tell me about a time you used automation to significantly improve reliability or deployment speed for SAP infrastructure.
28. Give an example where you had to balance performance, cost, and resilience for an SAP landscape—what trade‑offs did you make?
29. How have you enabled collaboration between BASIS, infrastructure, DevOps, and application teams when running SAP on cloud?
30. Describe a major production incident affecting SAP on cloud: how you diagnosed it, communicated with stakeholders, and prevented recurrence.

If you share the exact Google role (e.g., Cloud Architect, Customer Engineer, TSE for SAP) and level, more tailored, Google-style questions can be drafted, including “Googleyness” and cross‑functional collaboration angles.
